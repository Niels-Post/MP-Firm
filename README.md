For my internship at the AI lab at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, I designed and built a 
moving platform robot. This robot is able to provide physical measurements for the multi agent 
simulation framework the lab is building. 

This repository contains the firmware used for the robot, which can be built and flashed using PlatformIO.

The repository with the code for the raspberry pi control system can be found [here](https://github.com/Niels-Post/MP-Firm-Controller).

# The AI Lab

The [Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://ai.vub.ac.be/), founded in 1983 by Prof. Dr. Luc Steels, is the first 
AI lab on the European mainland. It is headed by Prof. Dr. Ann Now√© and Prof. 
Dr. Bernard Manderick.  During its history of more than three decades, 
the VUB AI Lab has been following two main routes towards the understanding of intelligence: 
both the symbolic route (classical AI) as the dynamics route (complex systems science).
